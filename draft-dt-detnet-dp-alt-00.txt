Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives        February 2016


1.  Introduction

   Deterministic networking (DetNet) [I-D.finn-detnet-problem-statement]
   provides a capability to carry unicast or multicast data streams for
   real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and known
   upper bound maximum latency [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture].  The
   deterministic networking Quality of Service (QoS) is expressed as 1)
   the minimum and maximum end-to-end latency from sender (talker) to
   receiver (listener), 2) probability of loss of a packet, 3)
   probability of loss of a packet in the event of the failure of a
   relay system or link.  Only the worst-case values for the mentioned
   parameters are concerned.

   There are three techniques to achieve the QoS required by
   deterministic networks:

   o  zero congestion loss,
   o  explicit routes,
   o  packet replications and deletion.

   This document identifies existing IP and Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Architecture (MPLS) [RFC3031], and layer-2 encapsulations
   that run over IP and/or MPLS data plane technologies that could be
   considered as the base line solution alternatives for deterministic
   networking data plane definition.  The full scope of the
   deterministic networking data plane solution is considered including,
   as appropriate, quality of service (QoS), operations and management
   (O&M), and time synchronization.

2.  Criteria for data plane solution alternatives

   Each deterministic networking data plane solution alternative is
   described and evaluated using the criteria describe in this section.
   The used criteria enumerated in this section is selected so that it
   highlights the existence or lack of features that are expected or
   seen important to a solution alternative for the data plane solution.

2.1.  Encapsulation and overhead

   In several cases a deterministic flow/strem has to be encapsulated
   inside other protocols, for example, when transporting a layer-2
   Ethernet frame over an IP transport network.  In some cases a former
   tunneling like encapsulation can be avoided by underlying transport
   protocol translation, for example, translating layer-2 Ethernet frame
   including addressing and stream identification into native IP
   traffic.  Last it is possible that talkers and listeners handle
   deterministic flows natively in a layer-3.  This criteria concerns
   what is the encapsulation method the solution alternative support:



Farkas, et al.           Expires August 5, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives        February 2016


   tunneling like encapsulation, protocol translation or native layer-3
   transport.  In addition to the encapsulation mechanism this criteria
   is also concerned of the processing and specifically the encapsulate
   header overhead.

2.2.  Stream identification

   The solution alternative has to provide means to identify specific
   deterministic flows / streams.  The stream identification can, for
   example, be explicit field in the data plane encapsulation header or
   implicitly encoded into the addressing scheme of the used data plane
   protocol.  This criteria concerns the availability and details of
   deterministic flow / stream identification the data plane protocol
   alternative has.

2.3.  Packet sequencing

   The solution alternative has to provide means for end systems to
   number packets sequentially and transport that sequencing information
   along with the sent packets.  In addition to possible reordering
   packets one of the important uses for sequencing is detecting
   duplicates.  In a case of intentional packet duplication a
   combination of stream identification and packet sequencing allows for
   detecting and discarding duplicates at the receiver (see Section 2.5
   for more details).  This criteria concerns the availability and
   details of the packet sequencing capabilities the data plane protocol
   alternative has.

2.4.  Explicit routes

   The solution alternative has to provide a mechanism(s) for
   establishing explicit routes that all packets belonging to a
   deterministic flow / stream will follow.  The explicit route can be
   seen as a form of source routing or a pre-reserved path e.g., using
   some network management procedure.  It should be noted that the
   explicit route does not need to be detailed to a level where every
   possible intermediate node along the path is part of the named
   explicit route.  The IEEE 802.1Qca [IEEE8021Qca] specification
   defines how to do explicit path control under IEEE 802 family of
   protocols and its IETF counter part defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-pcr].
   This criteria concerns the available mechanisms for explicit routes
   for the data plane protocol alternative.

2.5.  Packet replication and deletion

   End systems and/or relay systems can number packets sequentially,
   replicate them, and later eliminate all but one of the replicas, at
   multiple points in the network in order to ensure that one (or more)



Farkas, et al.           Expires August 5, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives        February 2016


   equipment failure events still leave at least one path intact for a
   deterministic networking stream.  The IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB]
   specification defines packet sequence numbering, packet replication,
   and duplicate packet identification and deletion for IEEE 802 family
   of protocols.  The deterministic networking data plane solution
   alternative at layer-3 has provide equivalent functionality.  This
   criteria concerns the available mechanisms for packet replication and
   duplicate deletion the data plane protocol alternative has.

2.6.  Operations and management

   The solution alternative should demonstrate an availability of
   appropriate standardized O&M tools or control/management plane that
   can be extended for deterministic networking purposes with a
   reasonable effort, when required.  The O&M tools do not necessarily
   need to be specific to the data plane protocol as it could be the
   case, for example, with MPLS-based data planes.

2.7.  Time synchronization

   The solution alternative may benefit from having a sense of time or
   at least that the associated O&M protocols had time synchronization
   properties.  One concrete example is Realtime Transport Protocol
   (RTP) [RFC3550], which carries timestamps in the protocol header in
   addition to sequence numbers, has a well specified algorithms, for
   example, for jitter calculations, and also has an associated control
   channel, the Realtime Transport Control Protocol (RTCP).  Another
   example could be residence time measurement support for MPLS network
   domain using Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) extensions.  This
   criteria concerns the available mechanisms for time synchronization
   in the context of the data plane protocol alternative.

2.8.  Class and quality of service capabilities

   Some protocols or encapsulation headers that may be viable as a
   solution alternative for the deterministic networking data plane may
   also have a capability to distinguishing between different classes of
   service (CoS) and/or the quality of service (QoS) for the payload
   flows / streams they transport.  Furthermore, this Criteria concerns
   the availability and mechanism for the CoS and QoS signaling as a
   part of the data plane protocol alternative.

2.9.  Packet traceability

   For the network management and specifically for tracing down
   implementation or network configuration errors any means to find out
   whether a packet is a replica, and which node performed replication
   can be very useful.  This criteria concerns the availability of
