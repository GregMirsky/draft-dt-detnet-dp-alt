 <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>Deterministic networking (DetNet) <xref target="I-D.finn-detnet-problem-statement"/>
     provides a capability to carry unicast or multicast data streams for real-time applications
     with extremely low data loss rates and known upper bound maximum latency
     <xref target="I-D.finn-detnet-architecture"/>. The deterministic networking Quality of
     Service (QoS) is expressed as 1) the minimum and maximum end-to-end latency from sender
     (talker) to receiver (listener), 2) probability of loss of a packet, 3) probability of
     loss of a packet in the event of the failure of a relay system or link. Only the
     worst-case values for the mentioned parameters are concerned.
  </t>
  <t>There are three techniques to achieve the QoS required by deterministic networks:
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>zero congestion loss,</t>
    <t>explicit routes,</t>
    <t>packet replications and deletion.</t>
   </list>
   This document identifies existing IP and Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture
   (MPLS) <xref target="RFC3031"/>, and layer-2 encapsulations
   that run over IP and/or MPLS data plane technologies that could be considered
   as the base line solution alternatives for deterministic networking data plane
   definition. The full scope of the deterministic networking data plane solution
   is considered including, as appropriate, quality of service (QoS), operations 
   and management (O&amp;M), and time synchronization.
  </t>

 <!--section title="Terminology">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
   target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
 </section-->


<section title="Criteria for data plane solution alternatives">
  <t>
   Each deterministic networking data plane solution alternative is 
   described and evaluated using the criteria
   describe in this section. The used criteria is selected so that it
   highlights the existence or lack of features that are expected and
   seen important to solution alternative for the data plane solution. 
  </t>
 

  <section title="Encapsulation and overhead">
    <t>
     In several cases a deterministic flow has to be encapsulated inside
     other protocols, for example, when transporting a layer-2 Ethernet
     frame over an IP transport network. In some cases former tunneling like
     encapsulation can be avoided by underlying transport protocol translation,
     for example, translating layer-2 Ethernet frame including addressing and
     stream identification into native IP traffic. Last it is possible that
     talkers and listeners handle determenistic flows natively in a layer-3.
     This criteria concerns what is the encapsulation method the solution
     alternative support: tunneling like encasulation, protocol translation or
     native layer-3 transport. In addition to the encapsulation mechanism this
     criteria is also concerned of the processing and specifically the 
     encapsulate header overhead.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Stream identification">
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide means to identify specific
     deterministic flows / streams. The stream identification can, for
     example, be explicit field in the data plane encapsulation header or
     implicitly encoded into the addressing scheme of the used data plane
     protocol. 
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Packet sequencing">
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide means for end systems to number packets
     sequentially and transport that sequencing information
     along with the sent packets. In addition to possible reordering packets one of the
     important uses for sequencing is detecting duplicates. In a case of intentional
     packet duplication a combination of stream identification and packet
     sequencing allows for detecting and discarding duplicates at the 
     receiver (see <xref target="repdup"/> for more details). 
    </t>
  </section>
  
  
  <section title="Explicit routes">
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide a mechanism(s) for establishing
     explicit routes that all packets belonging to a deterministic flow / stream
     will follow. The explicit route can be seen as a form of source routing or a
     pre-reserved path e.g., using some network management procedure. It should be
     noted that the explicit route does not need to be detailed to a level where 
     every possible intermediate node along the path is part of the named
     explicit route. The IEEE 802.1Qca [ref here] specification defines how to 
     do explicit path control under IEEE 802 family of protocols and its IETF 
     counter part defined in <xref traget="I-D.ietf-isis-pcr"/>.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Packet replication and deletion" anchor="repdup">
    <t>
       End systems and/or relay systems can number packets sequentially,
       replicate them, and later eliminate all but one of the replicants, at
       multiple points in the network in order to ensure that one (or more)
       equipment failure events still leave at least one path intact for a
       deterministic networking stream.
    </t>
    <t>The IEEE 802.1CB <xref target="IEEE8021CB"/> specification defines
       packet sequence numbering, packet replication, and duplicate packet 
       identification and deletion for IEEE 802 family of protocols. The
       deterministic networking data plane solution alternative at layer-3
       has provide equivalent functionality.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Operations and management">
    <t>The solution alternative should demonstrate an availability of appropriate
     standardized O&amp;M tools or control/management plane that can be extended for
     deterministic networking purposes with a reasonable effort, when required. The
     O&amp;M tools do not necessarily need to be specific to the data plane
     protocol as it could be the case, for example, with MPLS-based data planes.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Time synchronization">
    <t>Write here that it would be desirable if the 
      solution alternative has a sense of time or at least the associated
      O&amp;M protocols had time synchronization enhancements. One example could
      RTP, which carries timestamps in the protocol, has well specified
      algorithms for e.g., handling jitter, and the associated RCTP control
      channel. Another example could be
      residence time measurement support for MPLS network domain
      using Generic Associated Channel extensions. Other examples include
      IEEE 1588 extensions for MPLS.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Class and quality of service capabilities">
    <t>Describe here whether the solution alternative
      has means for distinquishing between service/quality classes and/or
      signal service quality changes in the network. The information can
      be in-band (e.g., bits in the encapsulation header) or out-of-band
      (e.g., auxillary control protocol).
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Packet traceability">
    <t>Describe whether the solution alternative provides
      any means for finding out whether a packet is a replication and
      which node performed replication and for what reason.
